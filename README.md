## Adding your token
If you're willing to fork this project, then the first thing you might want to do is to add your token. To do that:

1- Create a file `TOKEN.js` in the main directory.

2- Copy and paste the following code to the file
```
const TOKEN = "ADD YOUR TOKEN HERE";
exports.TOKEN = TOKEN;
```
3- Save the file and test if the bot is working.
